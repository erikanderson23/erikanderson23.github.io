       <div> <p1> My name is Erik Anderson. I grew up in Stoughton Massachusetts and currently freshman at The University Of Rhode Island. I enjoy playing video games and playing sports with my freinds. I also Enjoy camping and the outdoors and I am an Eagle Scout. My Favorite Sports teams are thye Redsox and the Patriots and I follow them closely throught their seasons. I chose URI because I loved the campus and it was close to home. I hope to graduate in four years with a degree in some form of Computer Science.  </p1>
